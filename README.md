# gradientizr

It's an app that applies a semi-transparent gradient layer to an image and
allow the user to insert text on top of the result.

Both the gradient and the text are customizable!

## Example

After:

## Known caveats

* It doesn't allow font selection (might become a feature at some point)
* It doesn't have a nice way of exporting the end result (want to fix this soon)
* Text positioning isn't as flexible as it might be (not a concern right now)
* All gradients are applied as 45 degrees (`to top right`) (not a concern right
  now)
* It doesn't resize images (not a concern)
